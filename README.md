# PIGMENT ACADEMY: OPEN SOURCE
Hi! Welcome to the open-source version of HackHead's Pigment Academy!

About this game: <br /> 
We at PigmentSoft want to bring older, simpler times to the new world, but it seems that people are more interested in vaping, "drip", and cancelling random people for no reason, while completely uninterested in our "boomer games". Ladies and gentlemen, we present Pigment Academy, an edutainment game full of biting commentary of the modern world, showing today's controversial topics just how silly they really are. <br />
Our game has such ravishing features as:
<ul>
 <li>Retro-esque 32-bit Graphics</li>
 <li>Swearing</li>
 <li>Fun Math Problems</li>
 <li>Swearing</li>
 <li>Laugh-Out-Loud Dialogue</li>
 <li>Swearing</li>
 <li>Amazing MIDI Soundtrack</li>
 <li>and more! (and also swearing)</li>
</ul>

Meet the students at our wonderful school:
<ul>
 <li>Blue, a sarcastic boy genius</li>
 <li>Yellow, a fat, but optimistic Mormon and Blue's best friend</li>
 <li>Red, a violently deranged demon with a troubled past, and</li>
 <li>Grey, a drunk midget that annoys everyone</li>
</ul>

FAQ: <br />
Q: Is Pigment Academy a kid's game? <br />
A: Far from it. To put things in perspective, <i> the first episode takes place in a massacre. </i> However, if you trust your kids enough to know fantasy from reality, you can let your kids play it. However, it's pretty up there. TL;DR, it's only bad for your kids if they can't handle it. <br />
Q: I want to mod the game! <br />
A: Although that's not really a question, feel free to mod the game all you want! (Just be sure to read the modding guide <a href="MODDING.md"> here, </a> and comply with our license <a href="LICENSE.md"> here./a>) <br />
Q: What's your inspiration for this game? <br />
A: I used to think school sucked because every class I went to treated me like crap. It got better in highschool, and my viewpoint isn't as bad now, but I'm still a critic of some things. <br />
Q: Why so crude? <br />
A: A wise man once said, "if it bleeds, it leads." The same thing can be said with crude humor. Plus, I use it to make a point, and for realism since actual highschoolers don't really have squeaky-clean vocabularies, either. <br />
Q: Can I use the game for school/work? <br />
A: While our license would allow you to, your boss/teacher might not like it. You could make a "school-safe" version if you wanted to, but you should still ask the guy in charge. <br />
